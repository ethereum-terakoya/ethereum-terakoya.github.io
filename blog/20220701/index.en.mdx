On July 1, 2022, EEA Japan (Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Japan) hosted the "What Interoperability Means for the Evolution of Enterprise Blockchain".

<br />
During the two sessions, the speakers presented the mechanism and types of "interoperability,"
a technology that connects different blockchains, as well as specific business applications,
and participants asked many questions during the QA session.
<br />
<br />
The session was not held online, but on site, and the networking session held
after the session was a lively exchange of ideas and opinions between the
speakers and the participants.
<br />
<br />
Speaker materials for each session are available below.

Interoperability, which plays the same role as Internet interconnection, will become even more important in the future. EEA Japan will continue to follow the latest trends and case studies of this technology.
