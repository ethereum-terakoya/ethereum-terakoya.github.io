Mr. Takahashi of Hitachi, Ltd. gave a video demonstration of finger vein authentication payment at a real store using PBI (Public Biometric Identification), and Mr. Hata of Square Enix presented the difficulties and innovations in commercializing NFT games, giving us a glimpse of the cutting edge in "blockchain execution".

Through the latest use cases, it was possible to get a sense of the steady progress of enterprise use of blockchain. Mr. Takahashi also informed us that the company is looking for a PoC (Proof of Concept) partner for the NFT anti-counterfeiting technology, which the company is researching and developing, that can prove that the signature (or mint) has been made by the person in question. EEA Japan will continue to follow the latest trends and case studies of enterprise blockchain so that it can be a place for co-creation among companies across industries.
