## Overview

### AMA event「Aya Miyaguchi and Vitalik talk about Ethereum and EF」

ETHTerakoya invited the Ethereum Foundation's Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguchi to answer various questions about Ethereum.Our moderators joined the pair to go in-depth into the activities and future path of the Ethereum Foundation. It was an opportunity to hear important information not available elsewhere.

Although there are still issues of security and cost, Ethereum 2.0 is making steady progress. Through this event, we were able to feel that development is proceeding resolutely despite the challenging development environment. We expect further changes to the situation after the upcoming merge.

#### Q1: What challenges is the Ethereum Foundation currently working the hardest to solve?

**Vitalik：**

Currently, our greatest focus is the completion of Ethereum 2.0 development.We are aiming for various improvements with Ethereum 2.0, so far, we raise the priority of the task for migration from proof of work to proof of stake.

Also, in terms of scaling, we feel we need to improve sharding in particular. We also need to work on improving overall productivity and energy efficiency.

**Miyaguchi：**

The main role of the Ethereum Foundation is to support an open-source ecosystem. Not all development projects occur within the foundation. Therefore, an eternal theme is, "How should we support community members?" There are challenges over which groups to provide grant funding to, and so on. We are also actively providing support that will increase the number of applications that can contribute to society as the platform grows.

#### Q2: Do you welcome those who participate in staking for the purpose of profit?

**Vitalik：**

Staking will naturally include some people participating for profit, and this is not a bad thing in itself. We have a structure where incentives are distributed for the provision of things worthy of reward.

#### Q3: How much will EIP-1559 contribute to the reduction of transaction speeds and the cost of gas? Could you give a quantitative estimate?

**Vitalik：**

Gas will not be cheaper for all. Only those users who have paid high prices will be affected. The biggest advantage of EIP 1559 is speed. We will be able to drastically reduce wait times between sending and receiving. With EIP 1559, one can pay a high fee to obtain higher speeds, but one may also achieve speeds one block or more faster than current speeds for a low fee.

#### Q4: What do you think is Ethereum's biggest weakness?

**Vitalik：**

You could say that the biggest issue is that fees are too high. Currently, many people are competing within a limited space, and this is likely what causes the high fees. Therefore, going forward, we will improve things like sharding and layer solutions and work to further expand the space.

**Miyaguchi：**

We often hear people say that development is slow and the timeline is opaque. However, this is a result of not compromising on the principle of decentralized development. Taking an application that is in use and updating it in a distributed manner is exceedingly difficult. I would like for everyone to understand that development takes time.

#### Q5: What is the source of Ethereum's value as a currency, and what meaning does this value have?

**Vitalik：**

Essentially, value comes from a background of human demand. Ethereum has multiple values such as the payment of transaction fees, its function as a guarantor for decentralized businesses, participation in applications, and so on.

### The roadmap for the Beacon Chain etc.

#### Q6: What is the future roadmap for the Beacon Chain?

**Vitalik：**

The Beacon Chain was developed for proof of stake. Currently, it has been running stable for three months. Going forward, we first plan to work on a hard fork. We believe this will improve efficiency and simplify the protocol.

The next milestone is merging, which will move proof of work in Ethereum's system such as contracts and transactions to the Beacon Chain. Once the merge is complete, sharding will be used to improve scalability. However, if an increase in users makes support difficult, we will change what we do in accordance with the situation.

#### Q7: What are your thoughts on the possibility of chain splitting induced by ETH 2.0?

**Vitalik：**

Those who decline the merge may continue to use existing proof of work. Even if there is a split into two, the split is unlikely to be large. We expect many will move to proof of stake.

The reason is that those who want to use proof of work have already moved to Ethereum Classic. So, at the merge stage, there will be few who wish to stay with conventional proof of work.

#### Q8: Do you have any plans to support smart contracts with shard chains in the future? Also, what are some applications that cannot be realized without supporting smart contracts with shard chains?

**Vitalik：**

There is no big difference between execution sharding and data sharding with rollups.However, we do plan to enhance sharding functionality going forward.

#### Q9: Was Ethereum development affected by COVID-19?

**Vitalik：**

Since development happened mainly happened online before the coronavirus, there was not a large impact. However, as face-to-face meetings did have an important role before the coronavirus, those meetings not being possible does make things feel challenging.

In the end, by making even fuller use of the internet, we were able to proceed very efficiently with development. I think we were able to achieve good results despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Q10: Staking has lower rewards than DeFi. How will you persuade people to participate in staking?

**Vitalik：**

I don't think there is a big difference between the companies. DeFi's current high interest rates are temporary and exist because many projects are being launched. This situation is unlikely to continue, so I expect things will eventually settle down.

### Optimistic Rollup / ZK Rollup etc.

<p style="margin-top: -1em;font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.2em;margin-left: 1em;">

#### Q11: Why do you like prediction markets?

**Vitalik：**

Prediction markets are a remarkably interesting area for me. If you watch them well, you can see what people expect of the future.

As prediction markets are open and less likely to be subject to bias, they are highly neutral. I am quite attracted to these kinds of self-regulating structures.

#### Q12: It seems that the increased complexity of Ethereum smart contracts also leads to increased learning costs for developers and users. I think providing learning opportunities will be a challenge for the Ethereum community. How do you plan on providing learning opportunities?

**Miyaguchi：**

In terms of learning, there is much more free instructional material available than when Ethereum was in its early stages.

As tutorials for beginners are becoming more widespread, I do not think you can say that learning costs are increasing.

However, with the increase in new information, there is certainly a problem with finding information that is necessary and correct. This is one reason why we participate in Q&As at such venues as ETHTerakoya.

#### Q13: One of the characteristics and strengths of Ethereum is that one can use it to achieve various things. Maintaining that strategy must have been difficult. Why were you able to continue to do so?

**Vitalik：**

The appeal of Ethereum is that it is an open platform. All kinds of people express their creative abilities in development. People are creating things I had never expected. For example, I never imagined NFTs. I am attracted to environments that can produce such unexpected value.

#### Q14: Which do you think will be more popular, Optimistic rollups or ZK rollups? Also, if both are used, what differences do you think will arise?

**Vitalik：**

ZK rollups are suitable for simple applications, and Optimistic rollups are suitable for things like smart contracts. I think Optimistic rollups will see use in the next few years, but ZK rollups will become more mainstream as encryption technology evolves.

### Ethereum and other chains etc.

#### Q15: How will Ethereum improve privacy in the future? Could you share your roadmap?

**Vitalik：**

We will advance AZTEC development and improve the privacy of smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs. However, as improving privacy generally leads to higher fees, we also need to work simultaneously on enhancing scalability. We expect fees to be even lower than they are now in an environment where rollups are adequately used.

#### Q16: What are your current views on quadratic funding and public goods?

**Vitalik：**

I think quadratic funding will be used in various ways in the future. Although it is still in its experimental stages, there are some successful examples of how Gitcoin Grants, etc. can be deployed for public goods. Going forward, we should see new projects both inside and outside the crypto ecosystem.

#### Q17: What do you think about other blockchains that have been coming out lately?

**Vitalik：**

There are currently many chains, some of which are very popular. I believe this is caused by Ethereum's high fees. However, as it is difficult to operate a centralized chain in the long-term, the situation will likely change in the future.

**Miyaguchi：**

Blockchain originally referred to decentralized technology. However, there currently exist some blockchains that are not decentralized. We would like for people to learn about this through events like this one.

#### Q18: Many "Ethereum killers" have been released since 2017. I think the projects that are not going well could pivot together to form something like an Ethereum satellite. What do you think of this, Vitalik?

**Vitalik：**

The pivot itself would be possible. Currently, rollups are things produced by the community in the early days of Ethereum, and there is no particular need to pivot. However, if rollups grow in the future, then new developments are a possibility.

**Miyaguchi：**

I can understand the feeling that once development has progressed to a certain extent, working together on development would be more efficient. However, joint development may not work well if the projects' intentions differ. Making such a decision is not easy.

#### Q19: What is the main selling point and goal of Enterprise Ethereum?

**Vitalik：**

The biggest feature of Ethereum is that it can be applied to various use cases. Originally, private chains were mainstream in enterprise companies, and large companies, in particular, needed private chains. However, there has not been significant progress lately in private chains. Public chains are showing more progress.

For this reason, companies have recently been increasingly adopting public chains, including Ethereum. Ethereum has problems with scaling and privacy. However, by improving on these problems, we hope that a wide range of both large and small companies will make use of Ethereum.
