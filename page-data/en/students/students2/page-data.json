Certifying information without exposing the underlying data refers to a method whereby calculations are performed that would only be possible in reference to the original data, acting as a single source of truth. For example, if you demonstrate that you know the private key corresponding to a public key without exposing the private key information, this implies that the attestor knows the private key, and the relying party does not know the private key. Suppose the attestor attempts to convey to the relying party that the former knows the private key. The relying party first generates a random value and passes it to the attestor. The attestor signs the private key with the random value. When the relying party verifies the signature with the public key, it implies that the attestor knows the private key. While the attestor has not exposed the contents of the private key to the relying party, it has conveyed its knowledge of said key's contents, allowing it to verify the authenticity of the transaction without leaking information. While the attestor has not shared the contents of the private key itself with the relying party, it is unable to properly sign the record without access to the private key, enabling it to authentically convey its ownership of said key. Using this paradigm, one is able to attest to the authenticity of various things by developing protocols around them.

This allows you to, for example, use that driver's license as a proof of identification to open a bank account without needing additional approval from the police department. In the cyber world, however, one's identity information exists in disparate locations, but we cannot currently make use of it. That is why today, there are methods being developed to allow a third party to confirm and digitize the content of this identity information and allow the user to autonomously control it without the agency of third parties. This would allow the user to combine the various identity information that pertains to them and use it to open accounts, apply for jobs, enter into apartment lease agreements, and other situations in which paper proof would normally be needed, but do it all online. Decentralized identity is also referred to as decentralized PKI.

Auctions, users bid the maximum price they are willing to spend, with the top bidder winning. In second-price auctions, the highest bidder pays the price bid by the second-highest bidder. This auction format works in favor of bidders. With distributed ledgers, however, an auction format would fail to be possible if everyone could see the contents of the ledger. This would instead lead to a public bid or open auction, impeding second-price auctions from coming to fruition. If you only allow the seller to see the bid status, it can lead to fraud, whereby the seller executes a smart contract against the second highest price as an argument. In this way, executing second-price auctions on the blockchain can be a challenge. Use of zero-knowledge proof in this case could be achieved by first deploying second-price auction code on the blockchain in the form of a smart contract. The amount bid by each bidder is hashed and kept private in order to prevent fraud and ensure that the system does not slide back into a first-price auction. Public keys could be used to hash the bid prices and then submit those to the seller (the party executing the smart contract), with the seller then executing the smart contract based on that. This allows for calculating the winner and 2nd price. Finally, zero-knowledge proof of the seller actually having executed the contract correctly is stored in the ledger. While the actual bid amounts are not disclosed, this testifies that the correct prices were used. If there were any fraud in the results, miners could check it. The encrypted bid amounts and zero-knowledge proof can be used to verify the validity of the auction results; in this way, zero-knowledge proof enables polling the arguments to a smart contract to obtain a verifiable outcome.\"), mdx(\"h4\", {\n    \"id\": \"performance-evaluation\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\"\n    }\n  }, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"h4\",\n    \"href\": \"#performance-evaluation\",\n    \"aria-label\": \"performance evaluation permalink\",\n    \"className\": \"header-anchor before\"\n  }, mdx(\"svg\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n    \"focusable\": \"false\",\n    \"height\": \"16\",\n    \"version\": \"1.1\",\n    \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n    \"width\": \"16\"\n  }, mdx(\"path\", {\n    parentName: \"svg\",\n    \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n    \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n  }))), \"Performance evaluation\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The evaluation method is designed based on LWE cryptography, out of consideration for resilience to quantum computing attacks, and implemented using some of the functions of libsnark, a standard library of zK-SNARK.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"User processing time (generating the zero-knowledge proof) grows relative to the circuit size, with evaluations of the hash function requiring 210 seconds and 300GB of memory to achieve the intended time outcome.

One sticking point, though, is that while in the physical world, people may not know what you have in your home, when it's digital, it's all out there in the open.

The more that becomes the norm, the more we can't simply have total transparency with everything, and the question becomes how to ensure privacy. As Mr. Naganuma said, zero-knowledge proof as a concept came about in the 1980s, but it only came into practical use after coming into the spotlight through blockchain technology. That means that there's a good chance that other algorithms or formulae that were previously on backburner may suddenly emerge thanks to developments in blockchain.
